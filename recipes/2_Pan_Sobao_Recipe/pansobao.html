    <br>
    <p>Puerto Rican pan sobao is a pillowy-soft, chewy, and semi-sweet bread with a soft crust, and it's utterly delicious. <br> 
        Pan sobao translates to "kneaded" or "rubbed" bread and is sometimes called pan de manteca ("lard bread"), <br>
        which is appropriate because lard is the key ingredient. After you taste this sumptuous bread, <br>
         you'll discover why it's so well-loved and rarely lasts long. It's famously enjoyed from Puerto Rican bakeries, <br>
         but an easy bread anyone—even beginners—can make at home. It may even become your family's new go-to white bread.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (170 milliliters) warm water (105 F to 115 F)</li>
        <li>1 (0.25-ounce) packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons (12 grams) white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (25 grams) lard, or vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups (300 grams) bread flour, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon (4 grams) kosher salt</li>
        <li>Cooking spray, for greasing bowl</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, add the warm water and stir in the yeast and sugar until completely dissolved. <br>
            Let it stand for 15 minutes to allow the yeast to bloom.</li>
        <li>Mix in the lard, or shortening, then about 1 cup of bread flour and the kosher salt. <br>
            Add more bread flour—about 1/4 cup at a time—until the dough begins to follow mixing spoon around the bowl.</li>  
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board. Knead for 10 minutes, adding bread flour in small amounts as needed when it becomes sticky. <br>
            (You may not use all of the flour.) The dough should be elastic and smooth.</li>  
        <li>Place the ball of dough in a lightly greased bowl and flip it over so both sides are greased. Cover with a lint-free kitchen towel and let rise for 45 minutes,<br>
             or until double in size.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough. Turn it out onto a very lightly floured board and form it into a ball. <br>
            Cover and let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently knead the dough for about 1 minute, dusting it lightly with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Form the dough into a ball, <br>
            cover with a towel and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough back and forth under your palms to shape the ball into a long baguette, about 12 inches long. As you roll, <br>
             work from the middle to the ends so the loaf is a relatively even thickness.</li>
        <li>Place the loaf on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Cover with a towel, <br>
             and let rise for 30 minutes, or until double in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F. When it's done proofing, place the bread on the oven's middle rack and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, <br>
             until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped underneath.</li>
        <li>Let the bread rest for a few minutes on the baking sheet, <br>
             then transfer to a baking rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
