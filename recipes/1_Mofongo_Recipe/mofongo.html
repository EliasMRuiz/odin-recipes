    <p>Mofongo is a popular Puerto Rican side dish made with fried green plantains mashed by hand together with chicharrones (crispy pork skin) and fresh garlic. <br>
        It's traditionally served with a red shrimp sauce (camarones guisados) or chicken broth, and makes for a super delicious side. <br>
        Because of the crispy texture from the pork rinds, it's best enjoyed fresh!</p> <br>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying the plantains</li>
        <li>green plantains</li> 
        <li>garlic cloves</li> 
        <li>chicharr√≥n (crispy pork skin) </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by heating your oil in a heavy bottomed frying pan over medium heat. <br>
        While your oil is heating, prep the plantains by peeling them and slicing into 1 inch thick slices.</li>

        <li>Once the oil is hot, gently add in the plantain slices and fry until golden brown and cooked through, <br>
            making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cooking them through should take about 10 minutes,<br>
             continuing to move them around in the oil occasionally so they cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Once fully cooked, remove them from the oil and dry on a paper towel lined plate.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl or your mortar and pestle, add the garlic and chicharrones and mash (using the back of a wooden spoon if you don't have a mortar and pestle). <br>
             Add the fried plantain slices and mash them in with the garlic and pork rinds.</li>
        <li>To serve your Puerto Rican Mofongo, fill a small bowl with the mashed plantains and flip onto a plate,<br>
             to get that perfect dome-like shape.</li> 
        <li>Top with a blend of cilantro, lime juice, and olive oil and serve with chicken broth or camarones guisados (shrimp in red sauce).</li>
