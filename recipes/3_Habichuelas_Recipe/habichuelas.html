    <p>Habichuelas Guisadas (Stewed Beans) – are the most flavorful beans simmered in a tomato and sofrito based broth with potatoes and olives. <br>
        Served over rice they are a meal unto themselves, or a classic staple with every Puerto Rican dinner!</p> <br>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>2 heaping tablespoons sofrito</li> 
        <li>2 cans (15-16 ounces) kidney, red or pink beans, drained and rinsed</li> 
        <li>1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) water </li>
        <li>1 packet Sazón with Coriander and Annatto (Culantro and Achiote)</li>
        <li>1 packet ham flavor (I use Goya Jamón) (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon adobo (I use Goya)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Manzanilla or Spanish pimento-stuffed olives</li>
        <li>1/2 pound potatoes, peeled and diced into large chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium caldero, sauté sofrito in oil 2-3 minutes over medium heat.</li>

        <li>Add tomato sauce, beans, water, sazón and ham packet. Season with pepper, adobo, garlic powder, oregano and stir. <br>
            taste and adjust spices according to your liking. Broth should be slightly salty since the potatoes will absorb much of the flavor.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes and olives and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are cooked through, <br>
            about 30 minutes or so, depending on their size. Serve over hot rice.</li>
